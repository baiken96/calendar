# calendar

This project implements several different calendar systems in use around the world from scratch in Java. Can convert dates to and from the standard Gregorian calendar and display common holidays. Includes implementations of the Easter Computus and Rosh Hashanah postponement algorithms.

Current implementation includes:
- Gregorian calendar (extends the Java LocalDateTime library)
- Hebrew calendar
- Tabular Hijri calendar
- Solar Hijri (Persian) calendar
- Roman Republican calendar
- Mayan calendar
- Decimal Solar calendar (fictional)

Observational calendars requiring complex lunar calculations (e.g., the Lunar Hijri and East Asian calendars) are not included, but may be added in a later release.
